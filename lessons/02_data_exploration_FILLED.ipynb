    "Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis often go hand in hand. \n",
    "- Without examining our data, it's difficult to know whether or not there are errors in it. \n",
    "- Without cleaning our data, our aggregate statistics may be skewed by errant data.\n",
    "The interplay of these processes is often very cyclical. For a data science workflow, these steps are essential to help us understand the nature of our data and ensure that we haven't injected or propogated unnecessary noise to our modeling algorithm. Oftentimes we will find ourselves circling back to data cleaning and EDA after modeling when we are dissatisfied with results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**No matter your goals working with data, becoming proficient with cleaning and EDA is amongst the most important skills you can learn.**\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Changes to distributions\n",
    "1. Reduction in variance\n",
    "1. Obfuscation of meaningful nulls\n",
    "1. Data is \"made up\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Many modeling techniques will require that you deal with all null values before moving forward, so there may be times that you have to impute missing values. A few common approaches include using:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The mean, median, or mode\n",
    "1. A random value selected from the distribution of values in the sample\n",
    "1. A placeholder to indicate missingness (e.g. -1, 999999, '?')\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these is imperfect, and in all cases, it's **imperative** to clearly indicate that you've edited missing values if you're going to store this data for later analysis. (Imagine coming across a dataset with a mostly normal distribution but a huge spike of values right at the median. How would you implicitly know whether this data were real or the result of data cleaning?)\n",
