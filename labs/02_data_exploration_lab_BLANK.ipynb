    "\n",
    "## Key Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which department had the most line item entries each year?\n",
    "- Which department had the highest total expenditures each year?\n",
    "- Which fund had the highest budget allocation each year?\n",
    "- What percentage of money from the general fund was allocated to different departments each year?\n",
    "- Which departments saw the largest budget increase and decrease from 2017 to 2018?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, you'll demonstrate the following skills:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skills Covered\n",
    "1. Module import\n",
    "1. Data import\n",
    "1. Masking\n",
    "1. Sorting\n",
